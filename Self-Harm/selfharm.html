  <h2> What is GAD?</h2>
  <p> Generalized anxiety disorder (or GAD) is marked by excessive, exaggerated anxiety and worry about everyday life events for no obvious reason. People with symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder tend to always expect disaster and can't stop worrying about health, money, family, work, or school. Everyone feels anxiety now and then - and there can be good reasons why.  But in people with GAD, the worry is often unrealistic or out of proportion for the situation. Daily life becomes a constant state of worry, fear, and dread. Eventually, anxiety can even dominate a person's thinking so much that they find it hard to do routine things at work or school, socially, and in their relationships. But there are treatments to ease anxiety so it’s not running your life. </p>
  <p>Nearly 4 million adult Americans, or about 2%, have GAD during the course of a year. It most often begins in childhood or adolescence but can begin in adulthood. It is more common in women than in men.</p>

  <h3> Causes </h3>
  <p> Experts don’t know the exact causes of generalized anxiety disorder. Several things - including genetics, brain chemistry, and environmental stresses - appear to contribute to its development.
    <p>   Some research suggests that family history plays a part in making it more likely that a person will have GAD. This means that the tendency to develop GAD may be passed on in families. But no anxiety genes have been identified, and families may also pass down the tendency through lifestyle or environment.
    <p>  GAD has been linked to problems with certain nerve cell pathways that connect particular brain regions involved in thinking and emotion. These nerve cell connections depend on chemicals called neurotransmitters that send information from one nerve cell to the next. If the pathways that connect particular brain regions don’t work well, problems related to mood or anxiety may result. Medicines, psychotherapies, or other treatments that are thought to work on these neurotransmitters may improve the signaling between circuits and help to improve symptoms related to anxiety or depression.
