  <h2> What is depression for a child  </h2>
  <p> Compared with adult depression, depression in children (6–12 years) and adolescents (13–18 years) may have a more insidious onset, may be characterised more by irritability than sadness, and occurs more often in association with other conditions such as anxiety, conduct disorder, hyperkinesis, and learning problems.</p>

  <h3> What causes depression in children? </h3>
  <p> As in adults, depression in children can be caused by any combination of things that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability, and biochemical disturbance. Depression is not a passing mood, nor is it a condition that will go away without proper treatment.</p>
  <h4> Can Depression in Children Be Prevented? </h4>
  <p> Children with a family history of depression are also at higher risk of depression. Children who have parents with depression tend to have their first episode of depression earlier than children whose parents don’t have the condition. Children from chaotic or conflicted families, or children and teens who abuse substances like alcohol and drugs, are also at greater risk of depression.</p>
  <h4> How Is Depression Diagnosed in Children? </h4>
  <p> If the symptoms of depression in your child have lasted for at least 2 weeks, schedule a visit with their doctor to make sure there are no physical reasons for the symptoms and to make sure that your child gets proper treatment. A consultation with a mental health care professional who specializes in children is also recommended. Keep in mind that the pediatrician may ask to speak with your child alone. A mental health evaluation should include interviews with you (the parent or primary caregiver) and your child, and any other psychological testing that is needed. Information from teachers, friends, and classmates can be useful for showing that these symptoms are consistent during your child's various activities and are a marked change from previous behavior. There are no specific medical or psychological tests that can clearly show depression, but tools such as questionnaires (for both the child and parents), combined with personal information, can be very useful in helping diagnose depression in children. Sometimes those therapy sessions and questionnaires can uncover other concerns that contribute to depression such as ADHD, conduct disorder, and OCD.</p>

  <h3> How can I tell if my child is depressed? </h3>
  <p> The symptoms of depression in children vary. The condition is often undiagnosed and untreated because symptoms are passed off as normal emotional and psychological changes. Early medical studies focused on "masked" depression, where a child's depressed mood was evidenced by acting out or angry behavior. While this does happen, particularly in younger children, many children display sadness or low mood similar to adults who are depressed. The primary symptoms of depression revolve around sadness, a feeling of hopelessness, and mood changes.</p>

  <ul> 
    <li> Crankiness or anger</li>
    <li> Continuous feelings of sadness and hopelessness</li>
    <li> Social withdrawal</li>
    <li> Being more sensitive to rejection</li>
    <li> Changes in appetite, either increased or decreased</li>
    <li> Changes in sleep (sleeplessness or excessive sleep)</li>
    <li> Vocal outbursts or crying</li>
    <li> Trouble concentrating</li>
    <li> Fatigue and low energy</li>
    <li> Physical complaints (such as stomachaches and headaches) that don't respond to treatment</li>
    <li> Trouble during events and activities at home or with friends, in school, during extracurricular activities, and with other hobbies or interests</li>
    <li> Feelings of worthlessness or guilt</li>

  </ul>
