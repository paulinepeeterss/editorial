  <h2> Ryan's Story </h2>
  <p> By time I was 18 years old, I had already endured five years of suffering alone with generalised anxiety disorder.
  As I matured into my teenage years, the increasing weight of anxiety uncomfortably resting on my chest, my ability to speak out flickered like a weak flame. Like a python securing its prey: with each attempt I made to struggle free, the tighter the grip became.
   I needed to be liberated from this vice-like hold. The problem I faced with my invisible perpetrator was that I knew very little about its weaknesses, and I was convinced that nobody else knew either.
  I began withdrawing from those closest to me. I was scared of hurting other people through actions which were out of my control. I decided to push as many people away from me as possible. It was brutal for me because I couldn’t justify why I was acting this way to the people who deserved to know the most.
  When you’re isolated and live within the constraints of your own mind, it’s difficult to see any way out of this prison.</p>
  <p> Anxiety makes you feel different from other people around you. You feel angry, emotionally exhausted and it makes everyday life excruciatingly painful to endure.
  I know, because I’ve been there; I’ve been right where you are. Until you decide what is worth more to you, pain or your happiness, this dense atmosphere will continue to work its way into any remaining courage and strength you have reserved in your heart.
  After five years of living in excruciating pain, on my 19th birthday that I decided to take this thing on head first. I had an epiphany about my suffering; I have the strength to endure this level of pain every day, from the moment I wake up, until I go to sleep. What if I could redirect that strength and focus that energy on my recovery?</p>
  <p> The first step was removing anxiety’s advantage over me: its invisibility. I decided to humanise my illness: I called the collective experience of anxiety my gremlins. Gremlins can be defeated, they can be trained and they can be managed.
  Once I humanised anxiety, I started to focus on what made it angry, what made it incredibly hard to control and when it was at ease, and I learned behaviours.
  Finally, I was willing to speak about what was going on in my head. The first time I admitted that I wasn’t alright out loud was the most terrifying experience of my life, but it’s the reason why I’m alive right now.
  Anxiety makes everyday life excruciatingly painful. </p>
  <p> I communicate about my illness with people who I trust. Because of this, I have formed the strength which has kept me going. Speaking out saved my life, and if you’re reading this and you feel alone because of your pain, I encourage you to do the same. I had momentary irrational thoughts of unleashing complete chaos by sharing my suffering, but they were quickly outweighed by the feeling of receptive love and compassion I experienced after I opened up.
  The irrefutable fact is this: people care about you. It may be a complete stranger or it may be your best friend, but they care. Focus on what you have complete control over: your choice to speak out and share your story.
  Today I have my anxiety (my gremlins) under control.
  Build a support system and your recovery will be on the right path, and your daily struggles will become that much more manageable.
  Remember this: pain is real but hope is real too. It’s up to you to choose which you believe in most.

  <h2> Sara's Story </h2>
  <p> My story is not that different from most people with an eating disorder. My struggle with bulimia fits the textbook definition and the similarities between my story and others are uncanny. But to me, it is unique, it is different and it is extremely personal. And my recent journey into recovery has been the proudest, most difficult accomplishment of my life. I am currently 25 years old and I have had issues with my weight and my self-esteem since junior high. I was your typical, awkward preteen. Chubby, braces, glasses, acne and a sweet, yet painfully shy, personality. I was self-conscious about everything, including my weight.</p>
  <p> As I entered high school, the concern I had about my body grew stronger. Then one day, I was home after school watching a talk show. The topic was eating disorders. I watched several young girls discuss their struggles with anorexia and/or bulimia. I listened intently as one girl described exactly how she made herself sick. A light went off in my head. I made my way to the washroom in a daze. I looked at myself in the mirror, still not entirely sure what I was doing. Then I pulled my hair back into a ponytail, knelt over the toilet and made myself sick. I wish, with all my heart, that I could tell every young girl or boy who is contemplating that very action for the first time (or the action of skipping a meal) – not to succumb. That it may seem like a great way to control your weight, but instead it wreaks havoc on your body. That you may think you’ll only do it once in a while, but like any addiction it will become your life. I wish I could tell them to say NO to that first, not so powerful, urge. To get out while they still can.</p>
  <p> My on again, off again relationship with bulimia throughout high school and university was not something I considered serious – at the time. It was my coping mechanism something I could fall back on when I was feeling fat, stressed or upset. I would go for weeks without making myself sick, the pattern was incredibly sporadic. I was in complete control of my bulimia. When I was 22 – bulimia gained control over me. I had just graduated from university. Society was expecting me to ‘go out and get a job’. Along with a job, I was supposed to get an income, a place to live and to support myself completely independently for the first time in my life. I was terrified. At this very time I was busy feeling rejected and worthless. A serious boyfriend had dumped me, for the second time in my life. It was not a great phase for me. I sank into a very depressive-like state. I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep and I spent my time either crying or listing reasons why I shouldn’t exist. As a result I began to lose weight. I didn’t even realize at first that I was getting smaller. My friends and family did. Everyone kept telling me how great I looked, but I couldn’t see it. It wasn’t until I was at work one weekend that I finally realized something was going on. My weekend job involved respite care for four elderly ladies. I was in the kitchen baking cookies for them, when one walked in and asked if I had lost weight. A question I had grown accustomed to hearing, but never from a person with dementia.</p>
  <p> Once I realized how much weight I had lost – I also realized I could never gain it back. When I had been heavier, I had been deemed ‘unlovable’. I had so many overwhelming feelings at this time in my life, and no idea what to do with them. Bingeing and purging was a temporary release for me, although I realize now that each bulimic episode was only intensifying my feelings. I continued spiralling downwards, constantly finding new methods of self-torture. I often scared myself with the intensity of my abusive actions. I consider myself a very loving, caring person and would never inflict harm on anyone. But I was certainly capable of inflicting harm on myself. I reflect back to this time as a very painful, lonely period in my life. I had no ability to look toward the future; all I knew was that this ‘behaviour’ was my life. This began to change during one very remarkable weekend. Two important things happened that weekend.</p>
  <p> One was that my mother stumbled across my ‘secret’. The second was that I met someone. That someone turned out to be my rock. He has been so supportive and affirmative throughout my entire journey. After several heart wrenching talks with my parents, sister and then-boyfrien (he is now my fiancée); I began a roller coaster of a journey. I explored several therapists and support groups before finding a good fit. I worked with an amazing dietician who helped me to rediscover the importance of food. I had intense sessions with a counsellor who assisted me in confronting my issues. I went up, I went down. I had days when I felt on top of the world. I felt in control, healthy and happy. I also had days where I hit rock bottom.</p>
  <h4> “I would scream at myself in the mirror not to succumb to the urge, and end up in a puddle of tears on the bathroom floor. ”</h4>
  <p> I continued on this path, but each time I caught a glimpse of recovery I would grow slightly stronger. And ever so gradually the time period between relapses would increase. Last fall, I had an opportunity to make a big life change. I left the hectic, rush of a big city to move to the small town where my fiancée lived. I accepted a job that allowed me to work four days a week. I began to make time for myself. I learned the importance of self-care and began to let go of self-abuse. And since we were finally together, my fiancée and I did something we’d always talked about. After a generous Christmas present from my father – we went to the local SPCA and adopted a cat. I will never underestimate the value of pet therapy. Today I am entering my fourth month of recovery. To some, that may not sound like a big deal. To me it is my greatest accomplishment. It is the longest stretch I have ever had. And though I still have far to go, this is the first time I have ever felt hope. Hope that my life will continue this way.</p>
  <p> I have learned so much from my battle with bulimia. I have learned about my own personal strength, which is more phenomenal than I ever would have realized. I have also learned the importance of a healthy lifestyle. These days I eat nutritional, well-balanced meals and incorporate healthy exercise into my day. And I enjoy this. I enjoy taking care of myself and living my life. I have also realized that the people in my life are more supportive and understanding than I could have ever known. My family, close friends and fiancée were by my side through each phase of the journey – never once casting judgement or anger my way. The most important thing I have learned is to appreciate myself as a person, not as how I look. My mother’s catch phrase ‘beauty comes from the inside’ does not fall on deaf ears anymore. I no longer measure my self-worth with a scale or tape measure. I feel beautiful because of who I am, how I treat others, and most importantly how I treat myself.</p>
  <p> Beauty is not a pimple-free face, or a tiny waist, or shiny hair, or any other airbrushed quality we witness daily in the media. It is who you are on the inside. And though I am proud of discovering who I am through my struggle, my greatest hope is that others will never have to work through an eating disorder to discover who they are.</p>
